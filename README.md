### Why Mobile Apps?

With the trend of technology shifting from computers into smaller mobile devices, skills pertaining to the creation, development and maintenance of mobile applications will become increasingly relevant in our society. In light of that, we would like to host a workshop that will help students with no coding experience who are interested in creating and developing mobile applications. 

### Goal of workshop:
The main aim of this workshop is to provide participants with a starting point which has often been seen as the biggest barrier to app development. 

### What do you need?

* Participants will be required to bring their own personal computer (Windows, MacOS or Linux) 
* Have [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) pre-installed for this workshop. 


In this workshop, we will walk through the makings of 2 simple mobile apps, namely a calculator and an alarm application.

## Basic coding concepts

These are some of the fundamental concepts we would first cover:

#### Data Types
```
String (Name) => “Desmond”, “Kelly”
Number (Age) => 16, 60
Array (Whatsapp group) => [ “Desmond”, “Kelly” ]
```

#### Boolean
```
if ( marks >= 70 )
	{ grade = “Distinction” ;}
elseif ( marks >= 40 )
	{ grade = “Pass” ;}
else
	{ grade= “Fail” ;}
```

#### Function
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello, world!");
	}

```
## Getting Started

#### In this workshop, we will walk through the makings of 2 simple mobile apps, namely a calculator and an alarm application.

To get started with your first App, you would need 2 things:

* the [Coding Presentation Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VJm-812tAT9mbMZmnCDekgYqxeajJ3YuDpnX5xUDJpA/edit?usp=sharing) at the beginning of this markdown document, which we will go through together during the workshop :)
* refer to the MobileAppDevAlarm and MobileAppDevCalculator folders respectively

*P/S: Screenshots of the Apps are in `screenshots` folder.*
